# pruning_regression
This repository contains the code to realize pruning procedure, as presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00940. In this case the main objective is to apply the procedure to a regression problem.
The module ```SpectralLayer.py``` contains an implementation of the spectral layer class written using PyTorch.

The notebook ```Pruning_regression.ipynb``` contains a usage example.
