# pruning_regression
This repository contains the code to realize pruning procedure, as presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00940. In this case the main objective is to apply the procedure to a regression problem.
The module ```Spectral_Layer.py``` contains an implementation of the spectral layer class written using PyTorch, while the module ```pruning_functions.py``` contains some useful functions for the examples reported in ```Pruning_regression.ipynb```, and ```spectral_regression.ipynb```.
